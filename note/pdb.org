  1. source activate py3
  2. find pdb path by ">> which pdb" for python2 or ">> which pdb3" for Python3
     ex) /usr/bin/pdb or /usr/bin/pdb3
  3. find python path by ">> which python"
     ex) /home/dhnam/bin/anaconda3/envs/py3/bin/python
  4. copy /usr/bin/pdb or pdb3 to /home/dhnam/bin/anaconda3/envs/py3/bin/pdb
  5. then open /home/dhnam/bin/anaconda3/envs/py3/bin/pdb
  6. change shebang
     ex) /home/dhnam/bin/anaconda3/envs/py3/bin/python

   in this example, pyvenv-workon should be applied for "py3"
