* EXWM Workspace Group
  Rough solution for managing workspace groups

** Note
   - Each workspace in the current group corresponds to each monitor.
   - Currently, it supports only dual and triple monitor configuration.
     - or you can modify ~ewg/init~ and define your own ~ewg/xrandr-*-monitor~.

** Example
*** Configuration
    #+begin_src elisp
    (require 'exwm-workspace-group)
    (ewg/init (list "HDMI-1-1" "DVI-I-1" "HDMI-0"))
    #+end_src

*** Interactive functions
    - ewg/other-workspace-in-group
    - ewg/other-workspace-in-group-backwards
    - ewg/swap-current-group-number
    - ewg/add-group
    - ewg/delete-other-groups
    - ewg/delete-current-group
