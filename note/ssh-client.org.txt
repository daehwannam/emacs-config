** SSH X11 forwarding
   https://askubuntu.com/questions/971171/how-to-use-putty-to-get-x11-connections-over-ssh-from-windows-to-ubuntu
   - Connection -> SSH -> X11
     - check "Enable X11 forwarding"
     - X display location: (empty) or localhost:0.0 or localhost:0
   - X11 display server, such as VcXsrv, Xming and MobaXterm, should be installed
     https://superuser.com/questions/119792/how-to-use-x11-forwarding-with-putty
     - VcXsrv is faster than Xming
     - MobaXterm is faster than Xming
     - MobaXterm also supports the ssh client feature

* MobaXterm
** 256color
   https://stackoverflow.com/q/54976656

   write the following line in ~/.bashrc
   $ # to support 256color for ssh-clients like MobaXterm
   $ export TERM=xterm-256color

   but it may cause problem in tmux (https://superuser.com/q/424086/908614)
   so write the following line in ~/.bashrc
   $ export TERM=screen-256color

   # but it may cause problem in tmux (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/18291)
   # so write the following line in ~/.bashrc
   # $ export TERM=rxvt-256color
