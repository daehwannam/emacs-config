* Install
  #+begin_src bash
  cd ~
  git clone --branch develop --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
  # conda install -c anaconda git # old git could cause error
  # enter "y" for y-or-n questions
  ~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install  
  #+end_src

  If something inexplicably goes wrong, try `bin/doom doctor`

  Below is the message after install:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  But before you doom yourself, here are some things you should know:

  1. Don't forget to run 'doom sync', then restart Emacs, after modifying
     ~/.doom.d/init.el or ~/.doom.d/packages.el.

     This command ensures needed packages are installed, orphaned packages are
     removed, and your autoloads/cache files are up to date. When in doubt, run
     'doom sync'!

  2. If something goes wrong, run `doom doctor`. It diagnoses common issues with
     your environment and setup, and may offer clues about what is wrong.

  3. Use 'doom upgrade' to update Doom. Doing it any other way will require
     additional steps. Run 'doom help upgrade' to understand those extra steps.

  4. Access Doom's documentation from within Emacs via 'SPC h d h' or 'C-h d h'
     (or 'M-x doom/help')

  Have fun!

* Doctor example
  $ bin/doom doctor

  Couldn't find the `fd' binary; project file searches will be slightly slower
  $ apt-get install fd

  Couldn't find shellcheck. Shell script linting will not work
  $ conda install -c conda-forge shellcheck
