* EXWM Workspace Group
  Rough solution for managing workspace groups for EXWM

** Note
   - Each workspace in the current group corresponds to each monitor.
   - You can create, delete or switch groups.
   - Currently, it supports only dual and triple monitor configuration.
     - However, you can define your own ~ewg/xrandr-*-monitor~ and modify ~ewg/init~.

** Example
*** Configuration
    #+begin_src elisp
    (require 'exwm-workspace-group)
    (ewg/init (list "HDMI-1-1" "DVI-I-1" "HDMI-0"))
    #+end_src

*** Interactive functions
    - ~ewg/other-workspace-in-group~
    - ~ewg/other-workspace-in-group-backwards~
    - ~ewg/swap-current-group-number~
    - ~ewg/add-group~
    - ~ewg/delete-other-groups~
    - ~ewg/delete-current-group~
