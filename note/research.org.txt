     - sometimes early stopping is not work:
       "Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization"
       it's when data is abundant & 'patience' is too small
       (but if 'patience' is too big, training needs much time)
** papers dont use ealy stopping?
   https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9omr67/discussion_early_stopping_why_not_always/
*** what's early stopping
    Absolutely! But from my understanding, the point of early-stopping is to prevent overfitting. Ideally, early-stopping stops training at the point where the generalization capability of the model is at its highest, and before overfitting starts (save best weights, stop training if no improvement in desired metric in the past N epochs).

** Sampling from probability density function with uniform distribution
   - f(x): probability density function (PDF)

   - F^-1(p): inverse function of CDF, whose domain is [0, 1]
   - Uniform(0, 1): uniform distribution from 0 to 1

   p ~ Uniform(0, 1)
   x' = F^-1(p) ; it's same that x' is sampled from f(x)
** Sampling from Gumbel distribution
   Gumbel distribution requires location mu and scale beta.
   We assume scale beta = 1

   f(x; mu) = exp(-((x - mu) + exp(-(x - mu))))
   F(x; mu) = exp(-exp(-(x - mu)))
   F^-1(p; mu) = mu - log(-log(p))

   p ~ Uniform(0, 1)
   x' = F^-1(p; mu) ; it's same that x' is sampled from f(x; mu) or Gumbel(mu, 1)

   Assume:
     \[\sum_{k=1}^n \alpha_k = 1\] and \[0 \leq \alpha_k \leq 1\]
     \[G_k \sim Gumbel(0, 1)\] for each k=1,..,n

   Let \[u_k=\log{\alpha_k}+G_k\]

   \begin{align*}
     \mathbb{P}(Z=k)&=\mathbb{P}(u_k \geq u_j,\forall j \neq k)\\
     &=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathbb{P}(u_k \geq u_j, \forall j \neq k|u_k)\mathbb{P}(u_k) du_k\\
     &=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \prod_{j\neq k}\mathbb{P}(u_k \geq u_j|u_k)\mathbb{P}(u_k) du_k\\
     &=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \prod_{j\neq k}\mathbb{P}(0 \leq u_k - u_j|u_k)\mathbb{P}(u_k) du_k\\
     &=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \prod_{j\neq k}\mathbb{P}(0 \leq u_k - (\log \alpha_k + G_k)|u_k)\mathbb{P}(u_k) du_k\\
     &=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \prod_{j\neq k}e^{-e^{-u_k+\log \alpha_j}} \mathbb{P}(u_k) du_k\\
     &=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \prod_{j\neq k}e^{-e^{-u_k+\log \alpha_j}} \mathbb{P}(U_k=u_k) du_k\\
     &=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \prod_{j\neq k}e^{-e^{-u_k+\log \alpha_j}} \mathbb{P}(G_k=u_k-\log\alpha_k) du_k\\
     &=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \prod_{j\neq k}e^{-e^{-u_k+\log \alpha_j}} e^{-(u_k-\log\alpha_k+e^{-(u_k-\log\alpha_k)})} du_k\\
     &=\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-\sum_{j\neq k}\alpha_je^{-u_k}} \alpha_k e^{-(u_k+\alpha_k e^{-u_k})} du_k\\
     &=\alpha_k \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-u_k-(\alpha_k+\sum_{j\neq k}\alpha_j)e^{-u_k}} du_k\\
     &=\alpha_k \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-u_k-e^{-u_k}} du_k\\
